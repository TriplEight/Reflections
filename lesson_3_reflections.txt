When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For example if I work remotely or from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If only some other contributors work on the same branches that I am, to avoid conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a cloned repository on GitHub. Used to have a cloned repository on GitHub.
	Clone is cloned repository or file on local. Used to have an identical copy of subj on local.
	Branch is only a different branch of commits of a file. Used in processing a file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
